# FoAM Kernow business learnings

*Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer or accountant. These are findings,
general principles and guesswork relating to FoAM Kernow only, so
please get professional advice on these matters.*

The purpose of this document is to record decisions we have taken
specific to our particular situation in order to:

1. Remember decisions made within the organisation.
2. Have it on public record for authorities as our mode of operation.

Firstly, what FoAM Kernow is are:

* A private company limited by guarantee.
* A 'non-profit' - more a US definition than a UK one but more widely understood.
* An SME (according to UK and EU rules).
* A research organisation (according to EU rules, as we have been registered and have a PIC number).
* A social enterprise - no strict definition exists but over 50% (100%!) of our profits are put back into the company to achieve our aims as specified in our articles of association.

# Tax

## PAYE

TODO 

## VAT

Our VAT situation is complex as our income comes from a mix of sources
and we look like different things in different situations. Sometimes
we are a university from a VAT perspective and sometimes a technology
company. The main point is that there can be no hard and fast legal
definitions from HMRC that can cover all possible cases, so we have to
interpret the rules ourselves and come to a decision as best we can.

We had to employ a VAT expert to go through our situation with us and
use their advice to provide the principles that we follow. The quotes
in this section come from documents they found for us.

## VAT Eligibility

VAT is tax on sales. In order to define what a sale is, VAT breaks
everything down into three classes of transactions:

1. Taxable (standard, reduced or zero rated)
2. Exempt (no VAT to pay e.g. the supplier is not VAT registered)
3. Outside the scope (not a sale)

The difference between standard, reduced and zero rated depend what
you are selling - books, children's clothes etc. We don't need to worry
about that, anything we supply will almost certainly be standard
rated.

Also Input/Output VAT is terminology referring to income and
outgoings. VAT happens in both directions.

VAT is problematic on grant funded work, as the VAT cannot be
reclaimed by the lead institution, meaning the project becomes 20%
smaller. It's my understanding that HMRC in any case do not want to be
collecting VAT on funding that is being provided by a different part
of the government as this is essentially a waste of time.

## Input VAT

VAT has a definition of 'supply' to define if it is a sale, and
taxable or not. A transaction is considered a supply and thus VAT
eligible if it has:

> at least two parties and a written agreement between them under
> which something is done for a consideration and by way of business.

The purchaser has to be supplied something, get something out of the
transaction.

Sometimes our work is supply, sometimes it is not.

### Outside of the scope of VAT type #1 - directly funded work

> Generally research is outside the scope of VAT when it is funded,
> either by the public sector or by the charitable sector, for the
> wider public benefit. However, this is only a general rule of thumb
> and each case must be considered on its own merits.

So if the funder doesn't expect anything back (except publicity and
getting their logo on things, presumably) then it's not a sale.

The first type of project we work on which is outside of the scope of
VAT is directly public funded work. It's therefore important we refer
to this as support: for example - the BSA supported the Sonic Kayaks
project, rather than paid us to supply a product or service for
them. This can be easy to define by who owns the "thing" made after
the end of the project - if it remains with us, we were supported,
with them - we supplied it to them.

### Outside of the scope #2 - funded work that is collaborative

If we are part of a collaborative project with a lead partner who is
redistributing funding to us - then this is not necessarily classed as
a supply:

> Provided HMRC is satisfied that the collaborative arrangement is
> genuinely non- business I.e., does not involve supplies for
> consideration, then it will accept that all research services
> provided by each of the collaborating bodies involved in the project
> are outside the scope of VAT, even if the funding may be passed on
> by the lead research body to others and that only the lead research
> body is party to the contract with the funding body.
>
> In order to evidence that a project is collaborative and that the
> funds passing between eligible bodies are not consideration for any
> supply for VAT purposes, HMRC may ask for evidence that research
> bodies are participating in collaborative research; the best
> evidence of that will be the original application for funding which
> would, in many cases, show who all the collaborative partners
> are. However, HMRC will accept any alternative evidence that clearly
> demonstrates that the bodies concerned were participating in
> collaborative research.

From all this we have come up with the official:

### FoAM Kernow VAT classification rules

We regard a project as a supply by default. The exceptions are if we
are receiving direct funding to support our work (type #1 above). The
second exception is where our role is as as a partner organisation on
a grant funded research project.

For type 2 to apply - fundamentally:

1. We need to be named on the funding proposal document.

and, preferably - but not essentially: 

2. There is a specific collaboration agreement.

This puts us into the same legal and tax situation as any other
research institution, or group of universities who collaborate
together. Also being a non-profit adds weight to this argument.

Therefore if someone comes to us to work on a research project after
it has already been funded, we need to charge 20% VAT if we were not
in on it from the beginning - as we cannot provide the proposal
document to show we are a partner organisation. (It's possible that if
we can be provided a collaboration agreement then it might also be Ok
- but for the moment we are playing it safe and ruling this situation
out.)

In the case that the coordinating partner expects us to charge VAT, we
do as we are told.

Regarding the tricky word 'subcontracting': "avoid it if you can but
as long as you can show the funds come from grants it should be OK."

The key here seems to generally come down to: "Did the funding body
get anything?"

### Output VAT

VAT on expenses is the fun part, as we get it back. However this is
also not simple, naturally.

If a project is outside of the scope of VAT it is not right to be
claiming VAT on expenses for that project.

It is ok, though to claim VAT for general costs, such as rent and
telephone costs - as long as we are working on VAT eligible projects
and they are needed for them.

### VAT returns

In order to calculate a VAT return, based on the above:

TODO: enumerate the box numbers these refer to...

1. Add up all the VAT we have 'collected' from our 'input' invoices.
2. Add up the VAT spent on total expenses for all projects inside the scope of VAT.
3. 1-2 is what we need to pay (or be paid if minus).
4. Add up all the expenses in total for all projects including subcontracting, but not salary.
5. Take 3 away from 4 and put it in box XX
6. Store all the invoices with the report pdf generated.

## Corporation Tax

Will be the sum of:

* 20% of what you have left in the bank account at your year end.
* Unpaid invoices for work carried out in that tax year.
 
Corporation tax is later recalculated based on your actual profit/loss
the following year.

As we are a non-profit our profit/loss must necessarily equal zero
over a sufficiently long time scale (as there is no legal way we can
extract money that does not show as an loss, unlike dividends to
shareholders).

However we must still complete corporation tax returns, which
sometimes we will need to pay out when we happen to show a profit, the
next year they will be paid back as a rebate when we show a
loss. Seems a waste of paperwork and time for us and HMRC both, as
well as needing to be taken into account for cash flow, but there we
go.

### R&D Tax Relief

Looking at the document [currently
here](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/corporation-tax-research-and-development-rd-relief)
and [the details currently
here](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/corporation-tax-research-and-development-rd-relief#uncertain)
we are eligible to ease the cash flow problem with corporation tax and
even potentially get some extra back by claiming for R&D tax
relief. 

Although we are a research organisation, the definitions are quite
specific (unlike those for VAT supply) so a conservative approach to
this is required. 

The more of these which are true, the more likely it is that a project
counts as R&D.

* Funding is classified as support rather than supply with regard to VAT.
* It's stated as a research project in the proposal.
* It is a prototype rather than a finished article.
* We expect to publish the work in academic journals.
* It is an open source project, so not solely for company gain. 
* It is a technological development of a natural sciences project.

Good candidates for this include Viruscraft and Sonic Kayaks.

What we can claim back:

* Director or employee salaries (time).
* Possibly 65% of subcontractor costs (as an SME) but there are further details for this.
* Material costs.

To quote the .gov:

> To be R&D, a company must be undertaking a project to seek an advance
> in science or technology through the resolution of scientific or
> technological uncertainties.

We make the claim that our citizen science projects fit under this
classification, and the results of the game (e.g. egglab) are used to
answer scientific questions.

Even our 'educational' games (in the case of viruscraft) qualify as we
are carrying out broader research in the form of workshops, developing
simulation models - and this has the capacity to lead to scientific
understanding (e.g. the hungry birds game where player's behaviour
during an educational game highlighted bad assumptions in the
underlying genetic modelling to do with predator perception).

> The advance being sought must constitute an advance in the overall
> knowledge or capability in a field of science or technology, not a
> company’s own state of knowledge or capability alone.

Two strong points here which :

* We regularly publish in peer reviewed journals - both regarding the
  insights generated by our work, and the work itself as novel
  methods.

* All our work is published free software/creative commons/open
source/open hardware - therefore they are able to be used to advance
broader technological uncertainties outside of our company. There are
specific instances where we know this as happened e.g. our open source
code being picked up and used in a neuroscience project.

Interestingly:

> If a particular advance in science or technology has already been
> made or attempted but details are not readily available (for
> example, if it is a trade secret), work to achieve such an advance
> can still be an advance in science or technology.

So reverse engineering is covered. However:

> Science is the systematic study of the nature and behaviour of the
> physical and material universe. Work in the arts, humanities and
> social sciences, including economics, is not science for the purpose
> of these guidelines. Mathematical techniques are frequently used in
> science, but mathematical advances in and of themselves are not
> science unless they are advances in representing the nature and
> behaviour of the physical and material universe.

So our citizen science work with the natural sciences is clearer than
work with penelope or for example livecoding projects when they are
treated as purely cultural research (which isn't usually the bit we
are directly involved in). It is clearer via technological
development:

> 17. Technology is the practical application of scientific principles
> and knowledge, where ‘scientific’ is based on the definition of
> science above.

It's possible that mongoose 2000 would be covered by this, as it's
published in a methods paper - but I don't feel happy with this
entirely.

> Similarly, work on combining standard technologies, devices, and/or
> processes can involve scientific or technological uncertainty even
> if the principles for their integration are well known. There will
> be scientific or technological uncertainty if a competent
> professional working in the field cannot readily deduce how the
> separate components or sub-systems should be combined to have the
> intended function.

This could really apply to a lot of software projects, as we tend to
use fairly conceptually straightforward projects (lions, cricket
tales) as experiments in combining new technologies.

> The design, construction, and testing of prototypes generally fall
> within the scope of R&D for tax purposes.

It's also ok for R&D projects to fail, which is nice.
