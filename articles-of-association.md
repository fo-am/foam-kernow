1.47 Any authorisation under this article 11 shall be effective only if:

(b) any requirement as to the quorum for consideration of the relevant matter is met without counting the Interested Director; and
(c) the matter was agreed to without the Interested Director voting or would have been agreed to if the Interested Director's vote had not been counted.

(f) permit the Interested Director to absent himself from the discussion of matters relating to the Conflict at any meeting of the directors and be excused from reviewing papers prepared by, or for, the directors to the extent they relate to such matters.
1.49 Where the directors authorise a Conflict, the Interested Director shall be obliged to conduct himself in accordance with any terms and conditions imposed by the directors in relation to the Conflict.
1.50 The directors may revoke or vary such authorisation at any time, but this shall not affect anything done by the Interested Director prior to such revocation or variation in accordance with the terms of such authorisation.
1.51 A director is not required, by reason of being a director (or because of the fiduciary relationship established by reason of being a director), to account to the Company for any remuneration, profit or other benefit which he derives from or in connection with a relationship involving a Conflict which has been authorised by the directors in accordance with these Articles or by the Company in general meeting (subject in each case to any terms, limits or conditions attaching to that authorisation) and no contract shall be liable to be avoided on such grounds.
1.52 Subject to sections 177(5) and 177(6) and sections 182(5) and 182(6) of the Act, and provided he has declared the nature and extent of his interest in accordance with the requirements of the Act, a director who is in any way, whether directly or indirectly, interested in an existing or proposed transaction or arrangement with the Company:

(d) may act by himself or his firm in a professional capacity for the Company (otherwise than as auditor) and he or his firm shall be entitled to remuneration for professional services as if he were not a director;
(e) may be a director or other officer of, or employed by, or a party to a transaction or arrangement with, or otherwise interested in, any body corporate in which the Company is otherwise (directly or indirectly) interested; and
(f) shall not, save as he may otherwise agree, be accountable to the Company for any benefit which he (or a person connected with him (as defined in section 252 of the Act)) derives from any such transaction or arrangement or from any such office or employment or from any interest in any such body corporate and no such transaction or arrangement shall be liable to be avoided on the grounds of any such interest or benefit nor shall the receipt of any such remuneration or other benefit constitute a breach of his duty under section 176 of the Act.

1.59 A director who is also an alternate director is entitled, in the absence of his Appointor(s), to a separate vote on behalf of each Appointor, in addition to his own vote on any decision of the directors (provided that an Appointor for whom he exercises a separate vote is an Eligible Director in relation to that decision), but shall not count as more than one director for the purposes of determining whether a quorum is present.
